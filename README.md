# Enigma-In-C
This is a replication of the famous [Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) encryption machine represented in C++ code. 

## Why?
I want to make something awesome in what I consider one of the most challenging but still highly useable languages -- C++. The enigma machine, made famous after WWII, is one of the first truly complex encryption machines to ever exist, and the mere fact that the enigma existed and had top minds working on it has lead to jumps and leaps in computing today. Replicating such a great piece of computing history in code feels meaningful. 

## Will this be useful upon completion?
Well, seeing as how the enigma was decoded without modern computers some 70+ years ago, I'm almost certain that it is no longer any sort of use for encryption purposes today. However, if you're simply interested in the way the Enigma encodes text or want to see how I personally implemented such a machine, you're in the right place.
